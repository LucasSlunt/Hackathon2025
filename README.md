# Hello, stars!

First place @ Girls in Tech "Hack Attack 2.0" Hackathon 2025 - University of British Columbia Okanagan.

Users are encouraged to get out of the house and stargaze, with each adventure earning them points. Users can upload their own pictures of the stars, and see which constellations are featured. The more a user learns about the stars, the more points they get! Users can also compete with their friends, trying to get more points, or show off their knowledge with badges!
